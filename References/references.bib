abstract="Many important problems in bioinformatics and genetics require analyses that are NP-complete. For example, one of the basic problems facing researchers that analyze pedigrees---data that represents relationships and genetic traits of a set of individuals---is evaluating whether they are consistent with the Mendelian laws of inheritance. This problem is NP-complete and several specialized algorithms have been devised to solve the types of problems occurring in practice efficiently. In this paper, we present PCS, a tool based on Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) that is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms, and more general. In fact, PCS can solve real pedigree checking problems that cannot be solved with any other existing tool.",

A backdoor is a set of variables that, if assigned correctly, leads to a polynomial-time solvable sub-problem. In this paper, we address the problem of finding all small backdoors, which is essential for studying value and variable ordering mistakes. We discuss our definition of sub-solvers and propose algorithms for finding backdoors. We experimentally compare our proposed algorithms to previous algorithms on structured and real-world instances. Our proposed algorithms improve over previous algorithms for finding backdoors in two ways. First, our algorithms often find smaller backdoors.

    abstract="The classical NP-complete problem of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) has seen much interest in not just the theoretical computer science community, but also in areas where practical solutions to this problem enable significant practical applications. Since the first development of the basic search based algorithm proposed by Davis, Putnam, Logemann and Loveland (DPLL) about forty years ago, this area has seen active research effort with many interesting contributions that have culminated in state-of-the-art SAT solvers today being able to handle problem instances with thousands, and in same cases even millions, of variables. In this paper we examine some of the main ideas along this passage that have led to our current capabilities. Given the depth of the literature in this field, it is impossible to do this in any comprehensive way; rather we focus on techniques with consistent demonstrated efficiency in available solvers. For the most part, we focus on techniques within the basic DPLL search framework, but also briefly describe other approaches and look at some possible future research directions.",

    abstract="It is well known that the ratio of the number of clauses to the number of variables in a random k-SAT instance is highly correlated with the instance's empirical hardness. We consider the problem of identifying such features of random SAT instances automatically using machine learning. We describe and analyze models for three SAT solvers -- kcnfs, oksolver and satz -- and for two different distributions of instances: uniform random 3-SAT with varying ratio of clauses-to-variables, and uniform random 3-SAT with fixed ratio of clauses-to-variables. We show that surprisingly accurate models can be built in all cases. Furthermore, we analyze these models to determine which features are most useful in predicting whether an instance will be hard to solve. Finally we discuss the use of our models to build SATzilla, an algorithm portfolio for SAT.",

    abstract="The class {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}q-Horn{\}}{\$}{\$}q-Horn, introduced by Boros, Crama and Hammer in 1990, is one of the largest known classes of propositional CNF formulas for which satisfiability can be decided in polynomial time. This class properly contains the fundamental classes of Horn and 2-CNF formulas as well as the class of renamable (or disguised) Horn formulas. In this paper we extend this class so that its favorable algorithmic properties can be made accessible to formulas that are outside but ``close'' to this class. We show that deciding satisfiability is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the distance of the given formula from {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}q-Horn{\}}{\$}{\$}q-Horn. The distance is measured by the smallest number of variables that we need to delete from the formula in order to get a {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}q-Horn{\}}{\$}{\$}q-Hornformula, i.e., the size of a smallest deletion backdoor set into the class {\$}{\$}{\backslash}text {\{}q-Horn{\}}{\$}{\$}q-Horn. This result generalizes known fixed-parameter tractability results for satisfiability decision with respect to the parameters distance from Horn, 2-CNF, and renamable Horn.",
